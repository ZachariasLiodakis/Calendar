# Daily Task Manager Android App

## üì± Overview
This Android application allows users to create, manage, and monitor their daily tasks. Each task includes information such as a short name, description, start time, duration, and location. The app automatically tracks task statuses over time and supports viewing, updating, deleting, and exporting tasks, as well as integration with other Android apps via a Content Provider.
